## Intro

Thank you for the opportunity!

The 3 options to input commands were:

- File
- Standard Input
- UI

I chose to implement the UI option, therefore this is no test data to exercise the application.

## Instructions

#### Run Application Locally

- Clone the repository
- Run `npm install` in the terminal to install dependencies
- Run `npm run dev` in the terminal

#### Production Version

You can view and use the application live [here](https://adrian-iacuone-connexion-test.netlify.app/)

#### Play Area

- Navigate to the robot page using the header link
- The robot page by default acts as a paly area, it was not part of the requirements but it was a part of my development process so I kept it as a play area.
- Feel free to use the buttons to move the robot around the play area.
- Take note of what happens when the robot reaches the edge of the play area.

#### Input/Output

- Navigate to the robot page using the header link
- Click on the input/output button under the table to open the input/output modal
- Input a place command first, add all the desired additional commands
- Click the 'move robot' button to execute the commands
- Observe the robots movements in the table
